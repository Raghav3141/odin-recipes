        <h2>Bread, meat, cheese, and vegetables combined into a tasty sandwich</h2>
        <p>A genuine muffuletta should be made on oven-fresh round Italian bread loves topped with sesame seeds. The spicy, tangy olive salad is what really sets this meat and cheese sandwich apart. These gigantic sandwiches were invented a century ago at Sicilian Deli here in New Orleans. Be sure to use high-quality ingredients as it really makes a difference!</p>
        <p>The muffuletta, the classic New Orleans sandwich, is surprisingly easy to make at home. This muffuletta recipe — complete with flavorful cold cuts, sliced cheese, and homemade olive spread — is authentically delicious.</p>
        <h2>What is a Muffuletta?</h2>
        <p>A muffuletta is both a type of sandwich invented by Italian immigrants in New Orleans and the type of bread it's served on. A muffuletta consists of a halved muffuletta loaf with deli meats (usually salami, ham, and mortadella) and olive spread. The large sandwich is cut into quarters, so one loaf of bread produces at least four servings.</p>
        <h2>Olive Salad</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup pimento-stuffed green olives, crushed</li>
            <li>½ cup drained kalamata olives, crushed</li>
            <li>½ cup pepperoncini, drained</li>
            <li>¼ cup roughly chopped pickled cauliflower florets</li>
            <li>¼ cup marinated cocktail onions</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped celery</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped carrot</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon celery seed</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sandwiches</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (1 pound) loaves Italian bread</li>
            <li>8 ounces thinly sliced Genoa salami</li>
            <li>8 ounces thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
            <li>8 ounces sliced mortadella</li>
            <li>8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>8 ounces sliced provolone cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the olive salad: Roughly chop together green olives, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, cauliflower, cocktail onions, garlic, capers, celery, and carrot.</li>
            <li>Combine with oregano, basil, black pepper, and celery seed in a medium bowl. Add in olive oil, canola oil, and vinegar. Mix together and transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container). Pour in more oil to cover if needed.</li>
            <li>Cover jar or container and refrigerate at least 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>To make the sandwiches: Cut loaves of bread in half horizontally; hollow out some of the excess bread to make room for filling.</li>
            <li>Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad, including oil.</li>
            <li>Layer bottom half of each loaf with 1/2 of the salami, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, and Provolone slices.</li>
            <li>Replace top half on each loaf and cut the sandwiches into quarters.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, or wrap tightly and refrigerate for a few hours; this will allow for the flavors to mingle and the olive salad to soak into the bread.</li>
        </ol>
